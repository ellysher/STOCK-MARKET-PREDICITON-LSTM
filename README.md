# Apple Stock Market Prediction using CNN-LSTM

## Overview
This project implements a **hybrid CNN-LSTM model** to predict Apple’s stock prices based on historical stock market data. The combination of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks enables effective feature extraction and sequential learning, improving prediction accuracy.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for financial time series.
- Implementation of **CNN-LSTM architecture** using **TensorFlow and Keras**.
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.
- Evaluation of model accuracy using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
- Visualization of predictions vs. actual stock prices.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

## Data Source
The dataset consists of Apple’s historical stock prices, obtained from **Kaggle**.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ellysher/apple-stock-prediction.git
   cd apple-stock-prediction
   ```
  

## Results
The **CNN-LSTM model** successfully captured stock price trends and demonstrated improved predictive performance compared to traditional models. Visualizations of actual vs. predicted prices showcase its effectiveness in time series forecasting.
